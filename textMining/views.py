Literature disclosed relationship between capital market and state variables; however the direction of causality still remains unsolved. This paper investigates the causal relationship between aggregate economic variables (gross domestic product, industrial production index, exchange rate, inflation and unemployment rate) and stock market, using quarterly data from 1992 to 2010. Granger causality test is applied to check the causality between the variables. Results indicate that there is bidirectional causality between stock market and three aggregate variables including GDP, IPI and Exchange rate. While unidirectional causality found between capital market and two macro variables i.e. Inflation and Unemployment, the direction of causality flows from aggregate variables to capital market. This study will facilitate the investors in taking effective investment decision by analyzing the macroeconomic factors, and estimating the direction of equity prices to allocate their resources effectively."}, "authors": {"count": 2, "authorList": [{"authorName": "Shahzad Butt", "authorIndex": 1, "university": {"universityName": "Bahria University", "universityCountry": "Islamabad Pakistan"}}, {"authorName": "Adnan Akhter", "authorIndex": 2, "university": {"universityName": "Bahria University", "universityCountry": "Islamabad Pakistan"}}]}, "references": {"count": 81, "referencesList": [{"referenceIndex": 1, "referenceName": " Long Run and Short Run relationship between macroeconomic variables and stock prices in Pakistan, the case of LSE.

Capital market got importance when it comes to the study of the developing economies; they are the barometer of the developing economy [1]. Factors that affect equity market are of great importance for investors [2]. Stock prices are modeled to be linear function of various macroeconomic variables [3].There are some risks associated with the state variables that describe the economy which are rewarded in the stock market [4]. Gan, et al. [5] argued that the stock market of comparatively small developed countries is also sensitive to change in macroeconomic variables. Inflation and interest rate is the best predictor of stock returns of developed countries [6].Efficient market hypothesis states that stock market prices always reflect the fundamental macroeconomic indicators [7]. Policy makers should take this in account that the aggregate real economy of the developed countries is cointegrated with the stock market [8]. Some macroeconomic variables lead stock returns, while others are led by them in developed countries but there is no causal relationship between macroeconomic variables and stock market in less developed countries [9].After 1991 post liberalization period in Pakistan, a strong association came in existence between stock prices and macroeconomic variables, which depicts that Pakistan stock market is sensitive to changes in the aggregate economic variables [10]. It became a level of attention for researcher to check the relationship between economic variables and stock prices after economic reforms in Pakistan. Sohail and Hussain [11] added that stock market returns can be increased if there is stabilization policy i.e. control of inflation and increase in industrial production. Different aggregate economic variables i.e. GDP, Inflation, exchange rate cause almost 80% of movements in the stock price at Karachi stock exchange [12]. Monetary policy factors and supply factors influence the stock market activities in emerging stock market [13] while there is existence of two way interaction between stock market and macroeconomic variables of emerging market [14].Not macroeconomic variables influence the stock market rather investor can predict the behavior of macroeconomic variables by using information of stock market [15]. Stock market is leading indicator for future growth in exchange rate, gold prices, money supply and industrial production because there exists a unidirectional causality from stock prices to aggregate demand [16].After economic reforms emerging stock markets started to play their role, the knowledge of cause and effect relationship got importance after that. Husain and Mahmood [17] extensively studied this relationship and concluded that Pakistan stock market is not developed enough to influence the economic policies and affect the aggregate demand, rather there is one way causation from aggregate demand towards stock market. Nishat and Shaheen [18] re-examined this relationship and found that there is a strong association between stock price and macroeconomic variables and two way causal relationship exists between stock market and macroeconomic variables. The equity market of Pakistan doesn’t represent the macroeconomic movements in country and fundamental news cannot be used to predict the stock market and vice versa [19].Numerous empirical studies have investigated the predictability of stock returns using different macroeconomic variables, and direction of causality between stock prices and real variables is not conclusive. But limited studies investigate about the causal relationship between stock market and aggregate economic variables by incorporating employment rate as the macroeconomic factor. The aim of this paper is to check the causal relationship between aggregate economic variables including employment rate, foreign exchange rate, GDP, inflation and Industrial Production. With reference to Pakistan there is limited work on relationship of employment and stock market. Atesoglu [20] concluded that there is a positive relationship between stock prices and employment, increase in stock prices leads to employment rate. The aim of this paper is to check that either stock market leads aggregate economic variables or vice versa. This work will be helpful for policy makers for future decision making.", "subsection": [], "tables": "", "pictures": "", "formula": ""}, {"title": "Literature Review", "text": "Impact of state variables on capital markets especially in emerging markets always remain focused area for researchers and it got importance in last few decades after financial liberalization and different economic shocks including Asian crisis, Global financial crisis etc. Several researchers investigated that either macroeconomic factors influence the stock market or vice versa during different time periods but empirical results are not conclusive. The relation of said variables are well analyzed for developed economies by Chen, Roll and Ross.Maghayereh [21] studied the impact of set of macroeconomic variables (Inflation, Exchange rate, Industrial production, and Interest rate etc.) on developing capital market and found that macroeconomic variables are significant in predicting the changes in stock prices. Bilson, et al. [22] studied the same relationship for the emerging markets and concluded strong association of equity markets with macro factors. Empirical studies showed that the performance of stock exchange in emerging market is the good leading indicator for future macroeconomic conditions. Tangjitprom [23] proved this phenomenon in his study. Mahmood and Dinniah [24] studied this relationship for six Asia pacific countries and found that there is short term relationship between economic factors and capital markets. Empirical evidences showed that investor can get excessive return by analyzing the macroeconomic factors, which contradicts the hypothesis of Fama.With reference to South Asian economies and especially for Pakistan different empirical studies conducted before and after financial liberalization to know the association between stock market and macroeconomic variables. Ahmed [25] studied the relationship of aggregate economic variables and stock market for India and found that stock market in India leads the economic activity. Ihsan et al. [26] studied the same impact for Pakistan the stock returns are influenced by set of financial and economic indicators including Industrial production, WPI, GDP, EX rate etc.", "subsection": [], "tables": "", "pictures": "", "formula": ""}, {"title": "Hypothesis 3: GDP is Positively Associated with Stock Market Stock price and GDP", "text": "Gross domestic product is the main indicator used to gauge the health of the country’s economy. In developed countries, implementation of stabilized government policies makes the economy healthy. Different researchers at different time of periods worked to establish relation between GDP and stock market. GDP and stock market move together overtime for developed countries. Duca [58] confirmed this movement in his study. He studied relation between top ten biggest stock market in world with their GDP. He explored that Stock market Granger cause the GDP of the developed country. Sawhney, et al. [59] checked this relationship in two developed economies i.e. Canada and USA. Johnsen co-integration and VECM was used to ascertain long run and short run relationship between the variables under study. They found that there is strong long run as well as short run relationship between GDP and stock price while GDP granger cause the stock prices only. Wang [60] checked this relationship in china and explored that Chinas stock market is not efficient enough like developed markets, so there is no long term relationship between stock prices and real GDP. Acikalin, et al. [61] employed co-integration test and vector correction model to check the causality between set of macroeconomic variables including GDP and stock price index. They found long term relation and uni directional causality from GDP to stock price index.With reference to South Asian economies, Cagli, et al. [62] explored the relationship between set of macroeconomic variables and stock price index during the period of structural breaks (Asian crisis, Global financial crisis etc.), they found that when there will be increase in GDP, the overall economy will grow and GDP is positively co-integrated with the stock market. With reference to Pakistan several studies contributed to add their findings in literature. Ihsan, et al. [26] explored that different set of economic and financial indicators affect the performance of KSE index. GDP significantly affects stock returns in case of Pakistan. Shahbaz, et al. [63] explored this relationship by using Engle-Granger and ARDL methods. They found that there is bidirectional causality between economic growth and stock market while in short run uni-directional causality exists that flow from stock market to economic growth. It is extensively argued by different school of thoughts about the role of stock market in economy. One is with the opinion that stock market performance is associated with economic growth and the other stated that economic growth may be the catalyst for stock market growth. Mun, et al. [64] tried to solve this issue for emerging markets and concluded that stock market Granger causes the economic growth. Government should promote the stock market to have growth in the real economy. Based on the literature it is obvious that there is strong positive relationship between GDP and stock market but the direction of causality is not conclusive in all studies.", "subsection": [], "tables": "", "pictures": "", "formula": ""}, {"title": "Research Methodology", "text": "This study explores the causal relationship between aggregate economic variables and Pakistan stock market for the period 1992 to 2010 by using quarterly data. In Pakistan financial liberalization was started in 1991, and according to different researches it is explored that macro factors influence capital markets after liberalization, that’s why I used data from 1992. The variables of interest in this study includes KSE 100 index, Industrial production index, Gross domestic product, Inflation, Unemployment rate and Exchange rate. All data sets are extracted from International Financial Statistics (IFS), World Bank data, UN data sources and Federal Bureau of Statistics Pakistan.To examine the relationship between aggregate economic variables and stock market return, following model has been tested;lnKt=β0+β1ln(GDPt)+β2ln(IPIt)+β3(lnExt)+β4ln(Inft)+β5ln(UNEt)+μWhereK=KSE-100 IndexGDP=Gross domestic productIPI=Industrial production indexEx=Exchange rateInf=Inflation rateUNE=Unemployment rate.Different techniques are available to test the causal relationship among the time series variables. The procedure for testing causality between aggregate variables and stock market is “Granger Causality” proposed by C.J Granger in 1969. According to Hill, Griffiths and Judge majority of financial variables, monetary variables and macroeconomic variables are non-stationary. So first to identify that either the variables are stationary or non-stationary I used Augmented Dicky Fuller test.", "subsection": [], "tables": "", "pictures": "", "formula": ""}, {"title": "Conclusion", "text": "This study explores the causal relationship among the industrial production index, gross domestic product, exchange rate, inflation, unemployment and stock market of Pakistan for the period 1992 to 2010 by using Granger causality test.
